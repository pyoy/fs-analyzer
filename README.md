# fs-analyzer
This program scans specified directories (or the current directory by default) to identify the top N largest subdirectories by total size and the top N subdirectories with the most files. It uses an efficient bottom-up aggregation algorithm to calculate sizes and file counts, avoiding redundant traversals.
